#Kata Fourteen: Tom Swift Under Milk Wood
Adapted from [Dave Thomasâ€™s work](http://codekata.com/kata/kata14-tom-swift-under-the-milkwood/).

This kata is an implementation of a trigram algorithm that generates a couple of hundred words of text using a book-sized file as input.

We use __python 3__ and pytest.
To run the script you will need a .txt file and the length of the desired output:
`python3 src/trigrams.py "sample.txt" 50`
